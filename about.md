I’m Federico G., and I’ve been deeply fascinated by computing for as long as I can remember. Over time, that curiosity turned into a focused passion for Microsoft infrastructure and identity/security platforms—things like Active Directory, Entra ID, and MECM are my playground.

On this blog, I write about the things I uncover in my day-to-day tinkering and professional tinkering: configuration challenges, automation tips, security observations, migration stories, and the “why” behind what works (and sometimes what doesn’t). My goal isn’t just to archive my notes, but to build a resource that’s practical, relatable, and helpful to others navigating similar stacks.

If you see something you resonate with, disagree with, or want to expand on leave a comment. I learn just as much from the conversation as from the experiments themselves.
